## Can I visit for 3-6 months?

Maybe.

If this is in the context of a longer term commitment, whereby we work together
for a longer-period and you spend a few months here, then can work out great
and I may even be willing to allocate some funding for that. Otherwise, a
period of less than 6 months is not enough time to be productive.
