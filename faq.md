## Can I visit for 3-6 months?

Maybe.

For more junior students who want to work on an existing project, short-term
visits can be win-win and feel free to [get in
touch](mailto:luispedro@big-data-biology.org) if you may be interested.

For more senior students or postdocs, who want to be driving their own
projects, then it's better if this is in the context of a longer term
commitment, whereby you spend a few months here, but we work together for a
longer-period. If this is interesting to you, then do [get in
touch](mailto:luispedro@big-data-biology.org).
