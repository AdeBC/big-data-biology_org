# Big Data Biology Lab Open Positions

## Postdoctoral researcher

We have a postdoc position open.

You will have the freedom to work on projects ranging from the purely
algorithmic to the biologically driven and we can even define a new project
that as long as it furthers the long-term interests of the group in _extracting
information from very large scale metagenomic datasets_ (see the [interests of
the lab](/interests/)).

Fudan University is considered the 3rd best university in China and is an
[internationally up and coming research
university](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/fudan-university).

Salary: 200,000 RMB (26,532 Euro) _per annum_ + subsidized housing.

### Qualifications

We are expecting you to have a strong background (including graduate work) in
one of the following areas:

- computational biology
- algorithmic bioinformatics development
- microbiome/microbial ecology or microbiology

Of course, it is not expected that you will know all of these areas deeply, but
you should be interested in them.

**To apply**: send an email to luispedro@big-data-biology.org with your CV and
one representative publication. Feel free to email with questions or to
approach me at conferences about this topic (my [personal
website](http://luispedro.org) will list upcoming travels).

Some **FAQs about the job in Shanghai**:

1. What's the cost of living in Shanghai?

It is hard to compare directly with a Western city: some things are _much
cheaper_, others _much more expensive_ (e.g., imported chocolate). Overall, it
is still cheaper than most of Europe (and you can get subsidized housing).

2. What about air quality?

Shanghai is one of the best places in China in terms of air quality, although
it is still bad by international standards. However, because of a high
awareness of the issue in China, air filters are common in public places. Thus,
the total exposure not as large as it would otherwise be.

You can check the air quality indices online:
