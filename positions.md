# Big Data Biology Lab Open Positions

## Postdoctoral researcher

We have a postdoc position open.

You will have the freedom to work on projects ranging from the purely
algorithmic to the biologically driven and we can even define a new project
that as long as it furthers the long-term interests of the group in _extracting
information from very large scale metagenomic datasets_ (see the [interests of
the lab](interests.html)).

Salary: 200,000 RMB (26,532 Euro) _per annum_ + subsidized housing.

To apply: send an email to luispedro@big-data-biology.org with your CV and one
representative publication. Feel free to email with questions or to approach me
at conferences about this topic.

Some **FAQs about the job in Shanghai**:

1. What's the cost of living in Shanghai?

It is hard to compare directly with a Western city: some things are _much
cheaper_, others _much more expensive_ (e.g., imported chocolate). Overall, it
is still cheaper than most of Europe (and you can get subsidized housing).

2. What about air quality?

Shanghai is one of the best places in China in terms of air quality. This means
that it is equivalent to the cities in Europe with poorer air quality (mostly
Eastern European cities). However, unlike in these European cities, because of
a higher awareness of the issue in China, air filters are common in public
places.

You can check the air quality indices online:
