# Big Data Biology Lab Projects & Interests

## Similarities and contrasts in the microbial ecology of different habitats

We are interested in looking at different habitats and comparing their
microbial ecology.

### Relevant papers

Pan, Gail Czarnecki-Maulden, Matthew Hayward, Sofia K. Forslund, Patrick
Descombes, Janet Jackson, Qinghong Li, and Peer Bork [Similarity of the dog and
human gut microbiomes in gene content and response to
diet](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-018-0450-3)

B. Sullivan, Jean Weissenbach, Patrick Wincker, Eric Karsenti, Jeroen Raes,
Silvia G. Acinas, Peer Bork, [Structure and function of the global ocean
microbiome](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1261359)


## Developing tools for very large-scale metagenomic analysis

We are interested both in developing new algorithms with applications to
large-scale metagenomics and in exploring tools that enable reproducible
science.

### Relevant papers & Links

- **Luis Pedro Coelho** [Jug: Software for parallel reproducible computation in
  Python](http://doi.org/10.5334/jors.161)
- [NGLess](https://ngless.embl.de)

## Exploring large-scale metagenomics datasets

We are interested in exploiting very large scale metagenomic datasets for basic
ecological questions.


## Possible collaborations

We are interested in working with clinical groups on issues of relevance to
human health or with groups with access to environmental samples.
