(June 2019—present)

Célio recently obtained his PhD degree on the use of bioinformatics to analyze
terrestrial organic matter degradation by Amazon river microbes through
metagenomics and population genomes at the Federal University of São Carlos
(UFSCar) - Brazil, and Institut del Ciencies del Mar - Barcelona, Spain (ICM).
Previously, his master's degree in the same instution was on the use of
computer technologies for _ab initio_ protein production, and his bachelor
degree is in Biotechnology and Biochemistry obtained at the Federal University
of Uberlândia (UFU) - Brazil, and at the Faculty of Science and Technology in
the University of Coimbra (FCTUC) - Portugal. His main interests range from the
interface of bioinformatics applied to metagenomics, machine learning and
protein structure. He specializes in the analysis of metagenomes and
metatranscriptomes, wet lab routines and also bioprospection of
biotechnological important proteins in environmental microbiota samples.

## Svetlana Ugarčina Perović (postdoctoral researcher)

![Svetlana Ugarčina Perović](/images/people/Svetlana Ugarčina Perović.png)

Svetlana is a microbiologist with expertise in high-throughput culture-dependent and culture-independent characterization of environmental and human microbiome. She holds a B.S. in Environmental Sciences and a Ph.D. in Environmental Microbiology from the University of Novi Sad (Serbia). Her postdoctoral work at the University of Glasgow (the UK) and University of Porto (Portugal) focused on drinking water microbiome in distribution systems and urinary microbiome in women health. She has been writing for the [Microbiome Digest](https://microbiomedigest.com/author/svetlanaup/), a daily on-line summary of scientific microbiome news. Her current interest includes computational approaches in microbial ecology to explore dynamics of antimicrobial resistome in the global microbiome.

## Hui Chong (research assistant)

![Hui Chong](/images/people/Hui Chong.jpg)

Hui is a research assistant at Big Data Biology lab. He obtained his Bachelor's degree in Huazhong University of Science and Technology - China, where he majored in Bioinformatics and studied microbiome. During his undergraduate, he has practical experience in motif finding, RNA-seq analysis, and especially microbial source tracking. His main interests range from method development to data-driven knowledge discovery in microbiome. He's also very interested in Machine learning, especially generalization of machine learning models in the contexts of microbiome.
