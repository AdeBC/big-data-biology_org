Célio recently obtained his PhD degree on the use of bioinformatics to analyze
terrestrial organic matter degradation by Amazon river microbes through
metagenomics and population genomes at the Federal University of São Carlos
(UFSCar) - Brazil, and Institut del Ciencies del Mar - Barcelona, Spain (ICM).
Previously, his master's degree in the same instution was on the use of
computer technologies for _ab initio_ protein production, and his bachelor
degree is in Biotechnology and Biochemistry obtained at the Federal University
of Uberlândia (UFU) - Brazil, and at the Faculty of Science and Technology in
the University of Coimbra (FCTUC) - Portugal. His main interests range from the
interface of bioinformatics applied to metagenomics, machine learning and
protein structure. He specializes in the analysis of metagenomes and
metatranscriptomes, wet lab routines and also bioprospection of
biotechnological important proteins in environmental microbiota samples.
