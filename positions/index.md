## Postdoctoral researcher

We have postdoctoral research positions open. One is [through the EMBARK
project](pd-embark/) (see that page for more details), but there are other
sources of funding.

You will have the freedom to work on projects ranging from the purely
algorithmic to the biologically or clinically driven and we can even define a
new project that as long as it furthers the long-term interests of the group in
_extracting information from very large scale metagenomic or imaging datasets_
(see the [interests of the lab](/interests/)).

See the [lab manual](/manual/) for information on how the lab works.

### Qualifications

We are expecting you to have a strong background (including graduate work) in
one of the following areas:

- computational biology
- algorithmic bioinformatics development
- microbiome/microbial ecology or microbiology

It is not expected that you will know all of these areas deeply, but you should
be interested in them.

**To apply**: send an email to
[luispedro@big-data-biology.org](mailto:luispedro@big-data-biology.org) with
your CV (preferably **without a photo**) and one representative publication.
Later in the process, you will be asked for two reference letters, but they are
not necessary for the initial application.

Feel free to email with questions or to approach me at conferences about this
topic (my [personal website](http://luispedro.org) will list upcoming travels).

Some **FAQs about the job in Shanghai**:

1. What's the cost of living in Shanghai?

Generally speaking, Shanghai is significantly cheaper than most of Europe and
North America. Some imported producted can end up costing significantly more
(e.g., European chocolates are a luxury product), but those are the exception
to the rule. Housing is also relatively expensive, but you can get subsidized
housing through the university.

Here is a website with information on the cost of living:
[https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Shanghai](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Shanghai).

2. What about air quality?

Shanghai is one of the best places in China in terms of air quality, although
it is still bad by international standards. However, because of a high
awareness of the issue in China, air filters are common in public places. Thus,
the total exposure not as large as it would otherwise be.

You can check the air quality indices online:

### More info

Salary: 235-285k RMB (based on experience) _per annum_ + subsidized housing
(this comes out to 30-36k Euro + the housing, but note that the [cost of
living in Shanghai](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Shanghai) is
significantly lower than in Europe).
