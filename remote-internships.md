In Summer 2020, Tobi Olanipekun Gabriel was a final year student at the
University of Ibadan, where he is studying for his Doctor of Veterinary
medicine Program (DVM). His scientific interests lie in the areas of Genomic
research and Big data analysis. interest in this area was born primarily by
online courses he had completed (such as the recently completed IBT course from
H3ABionet). This inspired him to take part in various research opportunities
(such as the NSURP program in conjunction with ISBTI Fudan University) from
where he gathers relevant experiences and skills in bioinformatics. He aspires
to pursue a career in genomics and to discover useful information from the
study of genomes via a masters and or PhD in this field. His other interests
include tutoring, web design (wordpress) and graphic design.
