## Postdoctoral researcher in the EMBARK project

The [EMBARK Project](http://antimicrobialresistance.eu/) is a
[JPIAMR](https://www.jpiamr.eu/) funded project which aims to establish
_background levels of antibiotic resistance_ across the world.

In this project, we have **funded one postdoctoral researcher position**. This
position is open until being filled.

The work is mostly computational (attempting to understand antimicrobial
resistance trends in public metagenome databases), but there is also some field
and lab work (collecting samples).

This will be done in collaboration with others, so if your current skill set
doesn't include all of this, but you are interested, then do apply!


### Qualifications

We are expecting you to have a strong background (including graduate work) in
either _computational biology_ or _microbiology_.

See the [lab manual](/manual/) for information on how the lab works.

See the [general positions page](/positions/) for more details, including
salary information (tl;dr: it's 30~36k Euro + access to subsidized housing).

**To apply**: send an email to
[luispedro@big-data-biology.org](mailto:luispedro@big-data-biology.org) with
your CV (preferably **without a photo**) and one representative publication.
Later in the process, you will be asked for two reference letters, but they are
not necessary for the initial application.

Feel free to [email](mailto:luispedro@big-data-biology.org) with questions or
to approach me at conferences (my [personal website](http://luispedro.org) will
list upcoming travels).
