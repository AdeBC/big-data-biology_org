Huayu holds his PhD degree from Research Center for Eco-Environmental
Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The research was based on
applying epicPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to microbiota and
sulfate-reducing prokaryotes for obtaining diversity, evolution and
environmental interactions. During his PhD, he was sponsored as Newton scholar
to visit Imperial College London in UK for a project about global climate and
microbes. Previously he did his Master of Philosophy in Biochemistry and
Biomolecular Sciences from Macquarie University, Australia and
investigated into a biocontrol strain Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 by gene
knock-out and oligonucleotide microarray. He is highly experienced in wet lab
techniques in fileds of molecular biology and microbiology. His main interests
now include bioinformatics and computational analysis on global distribution
of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
