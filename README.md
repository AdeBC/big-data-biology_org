## For group members updating the website

Five important subdirectories

1. `content/`: General purpose pages
2. `content/blog/`: the blog
3. `people/`: For members. 
4. `papers/`: For papers. There is a script (`add-paper-stub.py`) to help you get started.
5. `public/`: Files in these directories are just served directly. The
   subdirectories `images/people` and `images/papers` have a specific purpose
   (see `people/README.md` and `papers/README.md`, respectively)
